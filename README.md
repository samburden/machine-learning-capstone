## Machine Learning Capstone Project

This project attempts to classify products for an e-commerce company named, The Otto Group. Various machine learning algorithms/techniques are explored including XGBoost, AdaBoost, and neural networks. The idea for this project came from a Kaggle competition and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge).

This project is using Python 3 needs the following libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* jupyter notebook
* xgboost

The xgboost library can be installed using `pip install xgboost`. If on MacOS it might be helpful to look at the installation guide if you run into trouble using `pip install`. The documentation can be found [here](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html).

The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook and can be run using the following from a terminal:

```jupyter notebook capstone.ipynb```
